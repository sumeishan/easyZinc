Currently, there are no clinical guidelines to monitoring zinc status or supplementation while treating IBD pediatric patients. This section provides an overview of recommended guidelines for diagnosing and treating zinc deficiency and special accommodations with patients with gastrointestinal and malabsorption disorders.

# Diagnosis
Most commonly, patients are diagnosed with mild zinc deficiency, which can be asymptomatic or include symptoms like depressed immunity, impaired taste and smell, onset of night blindness, decreased spermatogenesis, and sometimes mild psoriasiform dermatitis (Prasad, 1998). For severe zinc deficiency cases, symptoms include hypogeusia, hyposmia, growth retardation, dermatitis, alopecia, gonadal hypofunction, abnormal pregnancy, susceptibility to infections, delayed wound healing, impaired glucose tolerance, emotional lability, mental disturbances, impaired taste, and smell, photophobia (Prasad, 2008). 

Zinc status is measured via a serum or plasma zinc test, and suggested cutoffs for plasma zinc concentrations to assess zinc deficiency in children less than 10 years old are suggested to be 65 mcg/dL in the morning and 57 mcg/dL in the afternoon (both unfasted) (King et al., 2015). Other considerations that are taken to account for diagnosing children are: infections, changes in steroid hormones, and muscle catabolism during weight loss or illness, inadequate caloric intake, chronic alcohol use, malabsorptive digestive diseases, and impaired growth (Hennigar et al., 2018).

Key Driver 1: Difficult Routine Screenings 
However, this test has limited sensitivity and specificity and due to its need for venipuncture, sample contamination may occur which makes serum zinc tests not very compatible for routinely screening healthy children without clear indications of deficiency. As a result, other biomarkers may be used in conjunction to diagnose zinc deficiency, such as serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The typical range for serum ALP is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L), but it may vary between labs (Pincus & Abraham, 2017)—lower ALP levels may also be another indicator for zinc deficiency. Additionally, patients in acute and chronic infections may also have lower levels of serum zinc, so some have suggested interpreting zinc concentrations with CRP levels for pediatric patients using the BRINDA regression correction (RC) approach (McDonald et al., 2020). 

# Treatment 
Zinc deficiency can be treated via parenteral, enteral, or oral supplementation. For the context of IBD pediatric patients, this paper will focus on oral supplementation. 

It is recommended for children to take 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of elemental zinc, and symptoms typically resolve within four to six weeks (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition, 2019). For children 6 months to 5 years of age, the recommended dose is 10 mg/day for 14 days, especially for those who are experiencing diarrhea (Lazzerini & Wanzira, 2016). 
For teenagers, dosages are not well defined, but adults have a baseline for 30 mg a day (2 to 3 mg/kg per day or 20-40 mg daily dose), and it typically resolves clinical symptoms of diarrhea within 1 to 2 weeks (Yanagisawa et al., 2008; Parrott et al., 2016)

Recommended forms of zinc supplementation are zinc orotate (KAL Zinc, 30 mg) and zinc gluconate (Swanson Zinc Gluconate, 30 mg) as well as zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, zinc aspartate, and zinc histidinate (Office of Dietary Supplements, 2021). In developing countries, a zinc sulphate 20 mg tablet (such as Baby Zinc) is recommended by WHO.

# Cautions 
Maximum zinc levels for children and teens have not been well recorded. In adults, doses more than 50 mg/day can cause further gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea; more than 150 mg/day may harm the immune system and lipid profile (King et al., 2011). Under high dosages, absorption of iron and copper can potentially lead to genito-urinary problems. When treating very young children, vomiting can occur after 15 to 30 mg dosages, but it is unclear whether it is because of zinc toxicity or because of zinc’s taste (Strand et al., 2002).

When zinc is given for extended periods of time, particularly at high doses, it is important to monitor the levels of copper in the blood.

# Considerations for Surgical Patients 
For patients with acute severe UC and CD, higher doses of zinc (more than 50 mg/day) may be acutely needed (Freitas et al., 2016; Parrott et al., 2016). oral replacement with 1 to 2 mg/kg per day. Moreover, low serum alkaline phosphatase is also measured in severe cases (Haase et al., 2008); however, again, close monitoring is imperative to avoid higher dosage toxicity, and it is important to monitor the levels of copper in the blood. Patients should have zinc and alkaline phosphatase levels monitored 3 to 6 months after supplementation and adjusted accordingly (Maxfield et al., 2022).
